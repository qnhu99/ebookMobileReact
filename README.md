## Why?

One of the best ways to learn a language is by reading books in it. However, readers frequently need to look up words from a dictionary, which can disrupt their concentration and immersion. This is where Duofolio comes in. It has a built-in translation system to quickly look up words by simply selecting them, without breaking your flow.
<br><br>
Duofolio supports bidirectional translation in more than a hundred languages.
